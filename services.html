                <p>
Our project focuses on mapping and monitoring mangrove areas along the Red Sea using
satellite imagery and machine learning. Mangroves play a critical role in carbon
sequestration, oxygen production, and protecting coastlines, but they are declining due to
climate change, pollution, and human activity.
By analyzing historical data, we aim to understand the factors driving mangrove loss and
develop strategies to restore and expand these ecosystems. Additionally, our model
predicts future mangrove health and coverage, helping guide conservation efforts.
Ultimately, the project seeks to preserve mangroves for their environmental benefits,
including climate regulation, biodiversity support, and coastal protection.

                <h2>Smart Carbon Emission Monitoring System: A Tool for Climate Action</h2>
                <p>In a world grappling with escalating climate challenges, from floods to desertification and ecosystem disruptions, managing carbon emissions is a key step toward mitigating environmental disasters. This project aims to equip decision-makers, particularly in local and global governments and monitoring institutions, with a smart tool that provides real-time data on carbon emission sources, their activity, and the total emissions from targeted regions. The objective is to support sustainability reporting, enforce accountability on emission sources, and provide critical data for climate conferences, such as the annual Conference of the Parties (COP).</p>
                
                <p>The system employs artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models to analyze satellite images of cities and industrial areas. These models can detect emission sources and calculate emission levels through various methods. For instance, the system analyzes smoke and other emission indicators from satellite images to estimate emissions from factories or public transport systems. It can determine the number of buses in operation and, based on the average emissions of a single bus, estimate the total emissions of the transport system. It also uses carbon spectrum images to track factory emissions, ensuring an accurate and comprehensive understanding of carbon output.</p>
                
                <p>The ultimate goal of this project is to address the climate threats expected within the next decade, primarily through carbon emission mitigation and the promotion of smart governance. Mitigation involves reducing the 34.81 billion tons of carbon emissions released annually to prevent global temperatures from rising by 1.5°C and possibly limit warming to 2°C. This can only be achieved by identifying emission sources and measuring their impacts. The system will also strengthen governance by holding the private sector and governments accountable for their emission contributions during climate summits like COP.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sustainable City Design:</strong> It helps in planning cities by balancing green areas and emission sources to minimize environmental harm.</li>
                <li><strong>Hospital Location Planning:</strong> By identifying areas with lower emissions, it aids in choosing safe locations for building healthcare facilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Emergency Detection:</strong> The system can predict environmental disasters by monitoring high emissions in specific areas, helping to initiate timely action.</li>
                <li><strong>Factory Emission Monitoring:</strong> It enables authorities to track factory emissions, facilitating the imposition of taxes, restrictions, or other accountability measures.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>In essence, this project is a proactive solution to climate change, aiming to reduce emissions, promote sustainable development, and safeguard communities from the looming dangers of environmental degradation.</p>

                    <h2>NEL PPCM: Platform for Project Planning and Crisis Management</h2>
                    <p>Our project centers on developing an AI-powered platform for urban planning and crisis management, designed to address the growing challenges of rapid urbanization and resource inefficiencies in cities. With the increasing complexity of modern cities, decision-makers in both the public and private sectors often struggle to allocate resources effectively, leading to infrastructure gaps, traffic congestion, and socio-economic disparities.</p>
                
                    <h4>Services and Business Planning:</h4>
                    <p>Our platform uses advanced AI and data analytics to provide real-time insights for optimizing urban planning. By integrating geographic, demographic, and environmental data, the platform enables decision-makers to determine the most effective locations for services like healthcare, education, and transportation. This improves service distribution, reduces resource wastage, and ensures sustainable urban growth. Additionally, our platform supports businesses, such as small and medium enterprises (SMEs), in selecting optimal locations for their operations, improving their chances of success and longevity.</p>
                
                    <h4>Crisis Management:</h4>
                    <p>In addition to urban planning, the platform is equipped with crisis management features. It analyzes real-time data to monitor potential crises, such as natural disasters, environmental risks, and public health emergencies. By providing early warnings and actionable insights, it helps cities and organizations mitigate the impact of crises. This feature is crucial for enhancing resilience, enabling governments and businesses to respond rapidly and effectively in emergencies.</p>
                
                    <h4>Impact:</h4>
                    <p>Our platform not only streamlines urban planning but also enhances crisis preparedness, reducing losses in financial and natural resources. By supporting more informed decision-making, it fosters sustainable development and improves the quality of life in cities. Ultimately, the platform serves as a comprehensive tool for modern cities to tackle the dual challenges of planning and crisis management.</p>
